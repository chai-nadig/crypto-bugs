    "Some days you are the bug, some days you are the windshield",
    "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, but love like a ladybug and live gracefully!",
    "People should just go out into the garden and watch a ladybug crawl across a flower and relax their mind. That's about all you need to know about life.",
    "The ladybug has to be the most feminist of insects. Even the male bugs are called ladybugs!"
