    "Ladybug ladybug, a bird's hunting game. Ladybird beetle is your name!!",
    "Snug as a bug in a rug",
    "Scent of damask roses upon the air, ladybug landing",
    "There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold, and she's bugging a stairway to heaven",
    "I'm sending luck and wishes all wrapped up in a hug. Good things should come your way with this tiny ladybug."
